If we inspect the EnterpriseDeserializer class, we learn that the program splits
the string that we give it on the colon ':' and interprets the first half as a
class name which implements a deserialize() method. If we then look at the
EnterpriseFlagPrinter class, we see that it implements a deserialize() method.
All we have to do is input EnterpriseFlagPrinter:<anything> as a new buzzword
and the program will print out the flag!

So I input EnterpriseFlagPrinter:ayy after choosing the option to create a new
buzzword and got (ironically) the flag:
ayy lmao

Yes, that's the actual flag. And yes, I could have accidentally guessed the
flag. ayy lmao.
