>> zbarimg $(ls | sort -n | grep "png") > factors.txt

Then, open up factors.txt and remove everything other than the values of the factors.

All we have to do is generated the TOTPs for each of these factors and then send
them to the server in that order. Since we don't want to do this manually, we
should write a script for it.
See solve.py for the rest of the solution.
