Looking at the source code, we notice that when we upload, it only checks the file headers for a valid image data. This is definitely vulnerable to a Remote PHP Code Execution.

So, we combine a PNG file header with a php script to list the contents of the directory.

> cat png-header directory-list.php > poison-image.php

Then we can upload this to the server to view the contents of the root directory on the server.
Viewing this script on the server, we get the following:
â€°PNG  flag_obdf3wodfsid0f87sb9f4bs9n90
Dockerfile
upload.php
index.php
uploads

So let's see the flag! http://imageit.p.tjctf.org/flag_obdf3wodfsid0f87sb9f4bs9n90

Flag: what_is_love??
