Using `binwalk tjctf-memes.jpg` we notice that there's a gzip file at position 305518

    305518        0x4A96E         gzip compressed data, has original file name: "getrekt.m9", from Unix, last modified: Fri Mar 13 15:12:17 2015

So, let's extract it:
    > dd if=tjctf-memes.jpg of=getrekt.m9.gzip skip=305518 bs=1

Then we can decompress the gzip
    > gzip -d getrekt.m9.gzip

The output looks a bit like base64 encoded data...
However, it's actually rot13'd base64 encoded data...
    > python decode.py

Looking at output.pcap, we notice that there's a pcap file sent in the ftp-data. We extract this by using "Follow TCP Stream" in Wireshark to get the ftp-data and save it as output2.pcap
Looking at output2.pcap, we see a lot of IRC messages... which we extracted into irc.log and irc2.log, two different streams for sending messages? In addition, we notice that there's a lot of base64 encoded data being sent around. Let's take all of that data and decode it.
    > python analye.py

What comes out seems to yet be another pcap file. However, this one is MUCH MUCH smaller and shows a GET request for flag.html. Following the TCP Stream of this gives us the flag!

Flag: BDFADD97
