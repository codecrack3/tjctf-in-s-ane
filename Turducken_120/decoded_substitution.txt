SAMUEL FINLEY BREESE MORSE )APRIL 27 1791 APRIL 2, 1872) WAS AN AMERICAN PAINTER AND INVENTOR. AFTER HAVING ESTABLISHED HIS REPUTATION AS A PORTRAIT PAINTER, IN HIS MIDDLE AGE MORSE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INVENTION OF A SINGLE-WIRE TELEGRAPH SYSTEM SED ON EUROPEAN TELEGRAPHS. HE WAS A CO-DEVELOPER OF THE MORSE CODE, AND HELPED TO DEVELOP THE COMMERCIAL USE OF TELEG PHY.

SA EL F. B. MORSE WAS BORN IN CHARLEST N, MASSACHUSETTS, THE FIRST CHILD THE PASTOR JEDIDIAH MORSE )1761 26), WHO WAS ALSO A GEOGRAPHER, D HIS WIFE ELIZABETH ANN FINLEY BREESE )1766 1828). 1 HIS FATHER WAS A GREAT PREACHER OF THE CALVINIST FAI AND SUPPORTER OF THE AMERICAN FEDERALIST PARTY. HE THOUGHT IT HELPED PRESERVE PURITAN TRADITIONS )STRICT OB RVANCE OF SABBATH, AMONG OTHER THIN ), AND BELIEVED IN THE FEDERALIST SUPPORT OF AN ALLIANCE WITH BRITAIN AND A STRONG CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. MORSE STRONGLY BELIEVED IN EDUCATION WIT2N A FEDERALIST FRAMEWORK, ALONGSIDE THE INSTILLATION OF CALVINIST VIRT S, MORALS AND PRAYERS FOR HIS FIRST SON. AFTER ATTENDING PHILLIPS ACADEMY IN ANDOVER, MASSACHUSETTS, SAMUEL MORSE WENT ON TO YALE COLLEGE TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION IN THE SUBJECTS OF RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY, MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE OF HORSES. WHILE AT YALE, HE ATTENDED LECTURES ON ELECTRICITY FROM BENJAMIN SILLIMAN AND JEREMIAH DAY. HE SUPPORTED HIMSELF BY PAINTING. IN 1810, HE GRADUATED FROM YALE WITH PHI BETA KAPPA HONORS. PAINTING EDIT SELF-PORTRAIT OF MORSE IN 1812 )NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY) MORSE EXPRESSED SOME OF HIS CALVINIST BELIEFS IN HIS PAINTING, LANDING OF THE PILGRIMS, THROUGH THE DEPICTION OF SIMPLE CL HING AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE'S AUSTERE FACIAL FEATURES. HIS IMAGE CAPTURED THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE FEDERALISTS CALVINISTS FROM ENGLAND BROUGHT TO NORTH AMERICA IDEAS OF RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT, THUS LINKING THE TWO COUNTRI . THIS WORK ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE NOTABLE ARTIST WASHINGTON ALLSTON. ALLSTON WANTED MORSE TO ACJMPANY HIM TO ENGLAND TO MEET THE ARTIST BENJAMIN WEST. ALLSTON ARRANGE WITH MORSE'S FATHER A THREE-YEAR STAY FOR PAINTING STUDY IN ENGLAND. THE TWO MEN SET SAIL ABOARD THE LYBIA ON JULY 15, 1811. IN ENGLAND, MORSE PERFECTED HIS PAINTING TECHNIQUES UN R ALLSTON'S WATCHFUL EYE BY THE END O 1811, HE GAINED ADMITTANCE TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY. AT THE ACADEMY, HE WAS M ED BY THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE AND PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE WORKS OF MICHELANGELO AND RAPHAEL. AFTER OBSERV G AND PRACTICING LIFE DRAWING AND ABSORBING ITS ANATOMICAL DEMANDS, THE YOUNG ARTIST PRODUCED HIS MASTERPIECE, THE DYING HERCULES. )HE FIRST MAD A SCULPTURE AS A STUDY FOR THE PAINTING.) TO SOME, THE DYING HERCULES SEEMED TO REPRESENT A POLITICAL STATEMENT AGAINST THE BRITISH AND ALSO THE AURICAN FEDERALISTS. THE MUSCLES SYMBOLIZED THE STRENGTH OF THE YOUNG AND VIBRANT UNITED STATES VERSUS THE BRITISH AND BRITISH-AMERICAN SUPPORTERS. DURING MORSE'S TIME IN BRITAIN, THE ERICANS AND BRITISH WERE ENGAGED IN THE WAR OF 1812. BOTH SOCIETIES WERE CONFLICTED OVER LOYALTIES. ANTI-FEDERALIST AMERICANS ALIGNED THEMSELVES WITH THE FRENCH, ABHORRED THE BRITISH, AND BELIEVED A STRONG CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO BE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS TO DEMOC CY. AS THE WAR RAGED ON, MORSE'S LE ERS TO HIS PARENTS BECAME MORE ANTI-FEDERALIST IN TONE. IN ONE SUCH LETTER, MORSE WROTE: 'I ASSERT THAT THE FEDERALISTS IN THE NORTHERN STATES HAVE DONE MORE INJURY TO THEIR COUNTRY BY THEIR VIOLENT OPPOSITION MEASURES THAN A FRENCH ALLIANCE COULD. THEIR PROCEEDINGS ARE COPIED INTO THE ENGLISH PAPE , READ BEFORE PARLIAMENT, AND CIRCU TED THROUGH THEIR COUNTRY, AND WHAT DO THEY SAY OF THEM... THEY CALL THEM DERALISTS COWARDS, A BASE SET, SAY THEY ARE TRAITORS TO THEIR COUNTRY AN OUGHT TO BE HANGED LIKE TRAITORS.' C ATION NEEDED JONAS PLATT, NEW YORK POLITICIAN, BY MORSE. OIL ON CANVAS, 1828, BROOKLYN MUSEUM ALTHOUGH JVIDIAH MORSE DID NOT CHANGE SAMUEL'S POLITICAL VIEWS, HE CONTINUED AS AN FLUENCE. CRITICS BELIEVE THAT THE ELDER MORSE'S CALVINIST IDEAS ARE INTEGRAL TO MORSE'S JUDGMENT OF JUPITER, ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT WORK COMPLETED IN ENGLAND. JUPITER IS SHOWN IN A CLOUD, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS EAGLE, WITH HIS HAND SPREAD ABOVE THE PARTIES AND HE IS PRONOUNCING JUDGMENT. MARPESSA WITH AN EXPRESSION OF COMPUNCTION AND SHAME, IS THROWING HERSELF INTO THE ARMS OF HER HUSBAND. IDAS, WHO TENDERLY LOVED MARPESSA, IS EAGERLY RUSHING FORWARD TO RECEIVE HER, WHILE A LLO STARES WITH SURPRISE. CRITICS H E SUGGESTED THAT JUPITER REPRESENTS D'S OMNIPOTENCE WATCHING EVERY MOVE T_T IS MADE. SOME CALL THE PORTRAIT A MORAL TEACHING BY MORSE ON INFIDELITY ALTHOUGH MARPESSA FELL VICTIM, SHE REALIZED THAT HER ETERNAL SALVATION WAS IMPORTANT AND DESISTED FROM HER W!KED WAYS. APOLLO SHOWS NO REMORSE FOR WHAT HE DID, BUT STANDS WITH A PUZZLED LOOK. MANY AMERICAN PAINTINGS THROUGHOUT THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY H RELIGIOUS THEMES, AND MORSE WAS AN RLY EXEMPLAR OF THIS. JUDGMENT OF JUPITER ALLOWED MORSE TO EXPRESS HIS SUPPORT OF ANTI-FEDERALISM WHILE MAINTAINING HIS STRONG SPIRITUAL CON CTIONS. BENJAMIN WEST SOUGHT TO PRESENT THE JUPITER AT ANOTHER ROYAL ACADEMY EXHIBITION, BUT MORSE'S TIME H RUN OUT. HE LEFT ENGLAND ON AUGUST 21, 1815, TO RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES AND BEGIN HIS FULL-TIME CARZR AS A PAINTER. THE DECADE 1815 1825 MARKED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN MO E'S WORK, AS HE SOUGHT TO CAPTURE TG ESSENCE OF AMERICA'S CULTURE AND LIFE. HE PAINTED THE FEDERALIST FORMER PRESIDENT JOHN ADAMS )1816). THE FE RALISTS AND ANTI-FEDERALISTS CLASHV OVER DARTMOUTH COLLEGE. MORSE PAINTED PORTRAITS OF FRANCIS BROWN THE COLLEGE'S PRESIDENT AND JUDGE WOODWAR )1817), WHO WAS INVOLVED IN BRINGING THE DARTMOUTH CASE BEFORE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. MORSE MAINTAINV A STUDIO AT 94 TRADD ST., CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA FOR A SHORT PERIOD. MORSE ALSO SOUGHT COMMISSIONS AMONG THE ELITE OF CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA. MORSE'S 1818 PAINTING OF MRS. EMMA QUASH SYMBOLIZED THE OPULENCE OF CHARLESTON. THE YOUNG ARTIST WAS DOING WELL FOR HIMSELF. BETWEEN 1819 AND 1821, MORSE WENT THROUGH GREAT CHANGES IN HIS LIFE, INCLUDING A DECLINE IN COMMISSIONS DUE TO THE PANIC OF 1819. UNABLE TO STOP THE R T WITHIN CALVINISM, HIS FATHER WAS FORCED TO RESIGN FROM HIS MINISTER L POSITION, WHICH HE HAD HELD FOR THRE DECADES. THE NEW BRANCH THAT FORMED WAS THE CONGREGATIONAL UNITARIANS, MORSE CONSIDERED THEM TO BE ANTI-FEDERALISTS, AS THEIR BELIEFS WERE RELATED TO RELIGIOUS SALVATION. ALTHOUGH SAMUX MORSE RESPECTED HIS FATHER'S RELIGIOUS OPINIONS, HE SYMPATHIZED WITH THE UNITARIANS. AMONG THE CONVERTS TO UNITARIANISM WERE THE PROMINENT PICKE NGS OF PORTSMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHOM MORSE HAD PAINTED. SOME CRITICS OUGHT HIS SYMPATHIES REPRESENTED HIS OWN ANTI-FEDERALISM. MORSE WAS COMMISSIONED TO PAINT PRESIDENT JAMES MONROE IN 1820. HE EMBODIED JEFFERSONIAN DEMOCRACY BY FAVORING THE COMMON MAN OVER THE ARISTOCRAT. MORSE HAD MOVED TO NEW HAVEN. HIS COMMISSIONS FOR THE HALL OF CONGRESS )1821) AND A PORTRAIT OF THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE )1825) ENGAGED HIS SENSE OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONALISM. THE HALL OF CONGRES WAS DESIGNED TO CAPITALIZE ON THE SUCC S OF FRAN OIS-MARIUS GRANET'S THE CAPUCHIN CHAPEL IN ROME, WHICH TOURED THE UNITED STATES EXTENSIVELY THROUGH T THE 1820S, ATTRACTING AUDIENCES WILLING TO PAY THE 25-CENT ADMISSION FEE. 2 THE CHAPEL OF THE VIRGIN AT BIACO, 1830 THE ARTIST CHOSE TO PAINT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,IN SIMILAR WAY, WITH CAREFUL ATTENTION TO ARCHITECTURE AND DRAMATIC LIGHTING. HE ALSO WISHED TO SELECT A UNIQUELY AMERICAN TOPIC THAT WOULD BRING GLORY TO THE YOUNG NATION. HIS SUBJECT DID JUST THAT, SHOWING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IN ACTION. HE TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON D.C. TO DRAW THE ARCHITECTURE THE NEW CAPITOL, AND PLACED EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE PAINTING. HE CHOSE TO PORTRAY A NIGHT SCENE, BALANCING THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE ROTUNDA WITH THE FIGURES, AND USING LAMPLIGHT TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK. PAIRS OF PEOPLE, THOSE WHO STOOD ALONE, INDIVIDUALS BENT OVER THEIR DESKS WORKING, WER EACH PAINTED SIMPLY BUT WITH FACES OF CHARACTER. MORSE CHOSE NIGHTTIME TO CONVEY THAT CONGRESS DEDICATION TO THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY TRANSCENDED DAY. THE HALL OF CONGRESS FAILED TO DRAW A OWD WHEN EXHIBITED IN NEW YORK CITY IN 1821. BY CONTRAST, JOHN TRUMBULL S DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE HAD WON PULAR ACCLAIM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. VIE3RS MAY HAVE FELT THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE HALL OF CONGRESS OVERSHADOWS TH INDIVIDUALS, MAKING IT HARD TO APPRECIATE THE DRAMA OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING. MORSE WAS HONORED TO PAINT THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE, THE LEADING FRENL SUPPORTER OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIO HE FELT COMPELLED TO PAINT A GRAND PORTRAIT OF THE MAN WHO HELPED TO ESTABLISH A FREE AND INDEPENDENT AMERICA. HE FEATURES LAFAYETTE AGAINST A MAGNIFICENT SUNSET. HE HAS POSITIONED LAFAYETTE TO THE RIGHT OF THREE PEDESTALS: ONE HAS A BUST OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, ANOTHER OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, AND THE THIRD SEEMS RESERVED FOR LAFAYETTE. A PEACEFUL WOODLAND LANDSCAPE BELOW HIM SYMBOLIZED AMERICAN TRANQU:ITY AND PROSPERITY AS IT APPROACHED THE AGE OF FIFTY. THE DEVELOPING FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MORSE AND LAFAYETTE, D THEIR DISCUSSIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, AFFECTED THE ARTIST AFTER HIS RETURN TO NEW YORK CITY. IN 1826 HE HELPED FOUND THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF DESIGN IN NEW YORK CITY. HE SERVED AS THE ACADEMY'S PRESIDENT FROM 1826 TO 1845 AND AGAIN FROM 1861 TO 1862. FROM 1830 TO 1832, MORSE TRAVELED AND STUDIED IN EUROPE TO IMPROVE HIS PAINTING SKILLS, VISIT G ITALY, SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. DURING HIS TIME IN PARIS, HE DEVELOPED A FRIENDSHIP WITH THE WRITER JAMES FE IMORE COOPER. 3 AS A PROJECT, HE PAINTED MINIATURE COPIES OF 38 OF THE LOUVRE'S FAMOUS PAINTINGS ON A SIN E CANVAS )6 FT. X 9 FT), WHICH HE /TITLED THE GALLERY OF THE LOUVRE. HE COMPLETED THE WORK UPON HIS RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES. ON A SUBSEQUENT VISIT TO PARIS IN 1839, MORSE MET LOUIS DAGUERRE. HE BECAME INTERESTED IN THE LATTER'S DAGUERREOTYPE THE FIRST PRACTICAL MEANS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. MORSE WR E A LETTER TO THE NEW YORK OBSERVER DESCRIBING THE INVENTION, WHICH WAS PUBLISHED WIDELY IN THE AMERICAN PRESS AND PROVIDED A BROAD AWARENESS OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. 4 SOME OF MORSE'S PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURES ARE ON DISPLAY AT HIS LOCUST GROVE ESTATE IN POUGHKEEP E, NEW YORK. 5 SAMPLES OF MORSE DYING HERCULES, MORSE'S EARLY MASTERPIECE.

IAP 8E110006 TELEGRAPH EDIT ORIGINAL SAMUEL MORSE TELEGRAPH AS NOTED, IN 1825 NE YORK CITY HAD COMMISSIONED MORSE TO PAINT A PORTRAIT OF LAFAYETTE, THEN VISITING WASHINGTON, DC. WHILE MORSE WAS PAINTING, A HORSE MESSENGER DELIVERED A LETTER FROM HIS FATHER THAT READ, 'YOUR DEAR WIFE IS CONVALESCENT'. THE NEXT DAY HE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIS FATHER DETAILING HIS WIFE'S SUDDEN DEATH. 6 MORSE IMMEDIATELY LEFT WASHINGTON FOR HIS HOME AT NEW HAVEN, LEAVING THE PORTRAIT OF LAFAYETTE UNFINISHED. BY THE TIME HE ARRIVED, HIS WIFE HAD ALREADY BEEN BURIED. 7 HEA BROKEN THAT FOR DAYS HE WAS UNAWARE OF HIS WIFE'S FAILING HEALTH AND HER DEATH, HE DECIDED TO EXPLORE A MEANS OF RAPID LONG DISTANCE COMMUNICATION. 8 WHILE RETURNING BY SHIP FROM EUROPE IN 1832, MORSE ENCOUNTERED CHARLES THOMAS JACKSON OF BOSTON, A MAN WHO WAS WELL SCHOOLED IN ELECTROMAGNETISM. TNESSING VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS WITH JACKSON'S ELECTROMAGNET, MORSE DEVELOPED THE CONCEPT OF A SINGLE-WIRE TELEGRA[Cddid]. HE SET ASIDE HIS PAINTING, THE GALLERY OF THE LOUVRE. 9 THE ORIGINAL MORSE TELEGRAPH, SUBMITTED WITH HIS PATENT APPLICATION, IS PART OF THE COLLECTIONS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN HISTORY AT THE SMITHSONIAN STITUTION. 10 IN TIME THE MORSE CODE, WHICH HE DEVELOPED, WOULD BECOME THE P MARY LANGUAGE OF TELEGRAPHY IN THE WORLD. IT IS STILL THE STANDARD FOR RHYTHMIC TRANSMISSION OF DATA. MEANWHILE, WILLIAM COOKE AND PROFESSOR CHARL WHEATSTONE HAD LEARNED OF THE WILHELM WEBER AND CARL GAUSS ELECTROMAGNETIC TELEGRAPH IN 1833. THEY HAD REACHED THE STAGE OF LAUNCHING A COMMERCIAL TELEGR H PRIOR TO MORSE, DESPITE STARTING LATER. IN ENGLAND, COOKE BECAME FASCINATED BY ELECTRICAL TELEGRAPHY IN 1836 FOUR YEARS AFTER MORSE. AIDED BY HIS GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES, COOKE ABANDONED HIS PRIMARY SUBJECT OF ANATOMY AND BUILT A SMALL ELECTRICAL TELEGRAPH WITHIN THREE WEEKS. WHEATSTONE ALSO WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH TELEGRAPHY A )MOST IMPORTANTLY) UNDERSTOOD THAT A SINGLE LARGE BATTERY WOULD NOT CARRY A TELEGRAPHIC SIGNAL OVER LONG DISTANCES. HE THEORIZED THAT NUMEROUS SMALL BATTERIES WERE FAR MORE SUCCESSFU AND EFFICIENT IN THIS TASK. )WHEATSTONE WAS BUILDING ON THE PRIMARY RESEARCH OF JOSEPH HENRY, AN AMERICAN PHYSICIST). COOKE AND WHEATSTONE FORMED A PARTNERSHIP AND PATENTED THE ELECTRICAL TELEGRAPH IN MAY 1837, AND WITHIN A SHORT TIME HAD PROVIDED THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY WITH A 13-MILE )21 KM) STRETCH OF TELEGRAPH. HOWEVER, WITHIN A FEW YEARS, COOKE AND WHEATSTONE'S MULTIPLE-WIRE SIGNALING METHOD WOULD BE OVERTAKEN BY MORSE'S CHEAPER METHOD. IN AN 1848 LETTER TO A FRIEND, MORSE DESCRIBES HOW VIGOROUSL HE FOUGHT TO BE CALLED THE SOLE INVENTO OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC TELEGRAPH DESPIT THE PREVIOUS INVENTIONS. 11 I HAVE BEEN SO CONSTANTLY UNDER THE NECESSITY OF WATCHING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MOST UNPRINCIPLED SET OF PIRATES I HAVE EVER KNOWN, THAT ALL MY TIME HAS BEEN OCCUPIED IN DEFENSE, IN PUTTING EVIDENCE INTO SOMETHING LIKE LEGAL SHAPE THAT I AM THE INVENTOR OF THE ELECTRO-MAGNETI TELEGRAPH WOULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED IT TEN YEARS AGO THAT A QUESTION COULD BE RAISED ON THAT SUBJECT? S. MORSE. RELAYS EDIT LEONARD GALE, WHO HELPED MORSE ACHIEVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH OF GETTING THE TELEGRAPHIC SIGNAL TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES OVER WIRE MO E ENCOUNTERED THE PROBLEM OF GETTING A TELEGRAPHIC SIGNAL TO CARRY OVER MORE THAN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF WIRE. HIS BREAKTHROUGH CAME FROM THE INSIGHTS OF PROFESSOR LEONARD GALE, WHO TAUGHT CHEMISTRY AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY )HE WAS A PERSONAL FRIEND OF JOSEPH HENRY). WITH GALE'S HELP, MORSE INTRODUCED EXTRA CIRCUITS OR RELAYS AT FREQUENT INTERVALS, AND WAS SOON ABLE TO SEND A MESSAGE THROUGH TEN MILES )16 K OF WIRE. THIS WAS THE GREAT BREAKTHROUGH HE HAD BEEN SEEKING. 13 MORSE AND GALE WERE SOON JOINED BY ALFRED VAIL, AN ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNG MAN WITH EXCELLENT SKILLS, INSIGHTS AND MONEY. AT THE SPEEDWELL IRONWORKS IN MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY ON JANUARY 11, 1838, MORSE AND VAIL MADE THE FIRST PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH. ALTHOUGH MORSE AND ALFRED VAIL HAD DONE MOST OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE IRONWORKS FACILITIES, THEY CHOSE A NEARBY FACTORY HOUSE AS THE DEMONSTRATION SITE. WITHOUT THE REPEATER, A THE RANGE OF THE TELEGRAPH WAS LIMITED TO TWO MILES )3 KM), AND THE INVENTORS HAD PULLED TWO MILES )3 KM) OF WIRES INSIDE THE FACTORY HOUSE THROUGH AN ELABORATE SCHEME. THE FIRST PUBLIC TRANSMISSION, WITH TH MESSAGE, 'A PATIENT WAITER IS NO L ER', WAS WITNESSED BY A MOSTLY LOCAL CROWD. 14 MORSE TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON, D.C. IN 1838 SEEKING FEDERAL SPONSORSHIP FOR A TELEGRAPH LINE BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL. HE WENT TO EUROPE, SEEKING BOTH SPONSORSHIP AND PATENTS, BUT IN LONDON DISCOVERED THAT COOKE AND WHEATSTONE HAD ALREADY ESTABLISHED PRIORITY. AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE US, MORSE FINALLY GAINED FINANCIAL BACKING BY MAINE CONGRESSMAN FRANCIS ORMAND JONATHAN SMITH. FEDERAL SUPPORT EDIT MORSE MADE HIS LAST TRIP TO WASHINGTON, D.C., IN DECEMBE 1842, STRINGING 'WIRES BETWEEN TWO COMMITTEE ROOMS IN THE CAPITOL, AND SENT MESSAGES BACK AND FORTH' TO DEMONSTRATE HIS TELEGRAPH SYSTEM. 15 CO RESS APPROPRIATED 30,000 IN 1843 FOR CONSTRUCTION OF AN EXPERIMENTAL 38-MILE )61 KM) TELEGRAPH LINE BETWEEN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND BAL MORE ALONG THE RIGHT-OF-WAY OF THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD. 16 AN IMPRESSIVE DEMONSTRATION OCCURRED ON M 1, 1844, WHEN NEWS OF THE WHIG PARTY'S NOMINATION OF HENRY CLAY FOR U.S. PRESIDENT WAS TELEGRAPHED FROM THE PARTY'S CONVENTION IN BALTIMORE TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING IN WASHINGTON. 16 THE FIRST TELEGRAPH OFFICE ON MAY 24, 1844, THE LINE WAS OFFICIALLY OPENED AS MORSE SENT THE NOW-FAMOUS WORDS, 'WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT,' FROM THE SUPREME COURT CHAMBER IN THE BASEMENT OF THE U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING IN WASHINGTON, D.C., TO THE B O'S MOUNT CLARE STATION IN BALTIMORE. 17 ANNIE ELLSWORTH CHOSE THESE WORDS FROM THE BIBLE )NUMBERS 23:23) HER FATHER, U.S. PATENT COMMISSIONER HENRY LEAVITT ELLSWORTH, HAD CHAMPIONED MORSE'S INVENTION AND SECURED EARLY FUNDING FOR IT. HIS TELEGRAP COULD TRANSMIT THIRTY CHARACTERS PER MINUTE. 18 IN MAY 1845 THE MAGNETI TELEGRAPH COMPANY WAS FORMED IN ORDER TO BUILD TELEGRAPH LINES FROM NEW YORK CITY TOWARD PHILADELPHIA, BOSTON, BUFFALO, NEW YORK AND THE MISSISSIPPI. 19 MORSE AT ONE TIME ADOPTED WHEA TONE AND CARL AUGUST VON STEINHEIL IDEA OF BROADCASTING AN ELECTRICAL TELEGRAPH SIGNAL THROUGH A BODY OF WATER OR DOWN STEEL RAILROAD TRACKS OR ANYTHING CONDUCTIVE. HE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO WIN A LAWSUIT FOR THE RIGH TO BE CALLED 'INVENTOR OF THE TELEGRAPH', AND PROMOTED HIMSELF AS BEING AN INVENTOR. BUT, ALFRED VAIL ALS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEVEL MENT OF THE MORSE CODE, WHICH WAS BASED ON EARLIER CODES FOR THE ELECTROMAGNETIC TELEGRAPH. PATENT EDIT MORSE WITH TELEGRAPH KEY MORSE RECEIVED A PATENT FOR THE TELEGRAPH IN 1847, AT THE OLD BEYLERBEYI PALACE )THE PRESENT BEYLERBEYI PALACE WAS BUILT IN 1861 1865 ON THE SAME LOCATION) IN ISTANBUL, WHIL WAS ISSUED BY SULTAN ABD LMECID, WHO PERSONALLY TESTED THE NEW INVENTION. 20 HE WAS ELECTED AN ASSOCIATE FELLOW OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES IN 1849. 21 THE ORIGINAL PATENT WENT TO THE BREESE SIDE OF TH FAMILY AFTER THE DEATH OF SAMUEL MORS IN THE 1850S, MORSE WENT TO COPEN_GEN AND VISITED THE THORVALDSENS MU UM, WHERE THE SCULPTOR'S GRAVE IS IN THE INNER COURTYARD. HE WAS RECEIVED BY KING FREDERICK VII, WHO DECORATED HIM WITH THE ORDER OF THE DANNEBROG. MORSE EXPRESSED HIS WISH TO DONATE HIS PORTRAIT FROM 1830 TO THE KING. THE THORVALDSEN PORTRAIT TODAY BELONGS TO MARGRETHE II OF DENMARK. THE MORSE TELEGR HIC APPARATUS WAS OFFICIALLY ADOPTED AS THE STANDARD FOR EUROPEAN TELEGRAPHY IN 1851. ONLY THE UNITED KINGD )WITH ITS EXTENSIVE OVERSEAS EMPIRE) KEPT THE NEEDLE TELEGRAPH OF COOKE AND WHEATSTONE. B IN 1858, MORSE INTRODUCED WIRED COMMUNICATION TO LATIN AURICA WHEN HE ESTABLISHED A TELEGRAPH SY EM IN PUERTO RICO, THEN A SPANISH CO NY. MORSE'S OLDEST DAUGHTER, SUSAN WALKER MORSE )1821 1885), WOULD OFTEN VISIT HER UNCLE CHARLES PICKERING WALKER, WHO OWNED THE HACIENDA CONCORDIA IN THE TOWN OF GUAYAMA. DURING ONE OF HER VISITS, SHE MET EDWARD LIND, A DANISH MERCHANT WHO WORKED IN HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW'S HACIENDA LA HE IQUETA IN THE TOWN OF ARROYO. THEY LATER MARRIED. 23 LIND PURCHASED THE HACIENDA FROM HIS SISTER WHEN SHE BECAME A WIDOW. MORSE, WHO OFTEN SPENT HIS WINTERS AT THE HACIENDA WITH HIS DAUG?ER AND SON-IN-LAW, SET A TWO-MILE TELEGRAPH LINE CONNECTING HIS SON-IN-LAW'S HACIENDA TO THEIR HOUSE IN AR YO. THE LINE WAS INAUGURATED ON MARCH 1, 1859, IN A CEREMONY FLANKED BY THE SPANISH AND AMERICAN FLAGS. 24 25 THE FIRST WORDS TRANSMITTED BY SAMUEL MORSE THAT DAY IN PUERTO RICO WERE: 'PUERTO RICO, BEAUTIFUL JEWEL WHEN YOU ARE LINKED WITH THE OTHER JEWELS OF THE ANTILLES IN THE NECKLACE OF THE WORLD'S TELEGRAPH, YOURS WILL NOT SHINE LESS BRILLIANTLY IN THE CROWN OF YOUR QUEEN ' 23 THERE IS AN ARGUMENT AMONGST HISTORIANS THAT MORSE MAY H E RECEIVED THE IDEA OF A PLAUSIBLE TELEGRAPH FROM HARRISON GRAY DYAR SOME EIGHTEEN YEARS EARLIER THAN HIS PATENT. C POLITICAL VIEWS EDIT MORSE WAS A LEADER IN THE ANTI-CATHOLIC AND ANTI-IMMIGRATION MOVEMENT OF THE MID-19TH CE URY. IN 1836, HE RAN UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR MAYOR OF NEW YORK UNDER THE ANTI-IMMIGRANT NATIVIST PARTY'S BANNER, RECEIVING ONLY 1496 VOTES. WHEN MORSE VISITED ROME, HE ALLEGEDLY REFUSED TO TAKE HIS HAT OFF IN THE PRESENCE OF THE POPE. MORSE WORKED TO UNITE PROTESTANTS AGAINST CATHOLIC INSTITUTIONS )INCLUDING SCHOOLS), WANTV TO FORBID CATHOLICS FROM HOLDING PU IC OFFICE, AND PROMOTED CHANGING IMMIGRATION LAWS TO LIMIT IMMIGRATION FROM CATHOLIC COUNTRIES. ON THIS TOP!, HE WROTE, 'WE MUST FIRST STOP THE LEAK IN THE SHIP THROUGH WHICH MUDDY WATERS FROM WITHOUT THREATEN TO SINK U ' 27 HE WROTE NUMEROUS LETTERS TO THE NEW YORK OBSERVER )HIS BROTHER SIDNEY WAS THE EDITOR AT THE TIME) URGING PEOPLE TO FIGHT THE PERCEIVED CATHOLIC MENACE. THESE WERE WIDELY REPRINTED IN OTGR NEWSPAPERS. AMONG OTHER CLAIMS, HE BELIEVED THAT THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT AND CATHOLIC AID ORGANIZATIONS WERE SUBSIDIZING CATHOLIC IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO GAIN CONT L OF THE COUNTRY. 28 IN HIS FOREIGN JNSPIRACY AGAINST THE LIBERTIES OF THE UNITED STATES, 29 MORSE WROTE: SURELY AMERICAN PROTESTANTS, FREEMEN, HAVE DISCERNMENT ENOUGH TO DISCOVER BENE H THEM THE CLOVEN FOOT OF THIS SUBTLE FOREIGN HERESY. THEY WILL SEE THAT POPE( IS NOW, WHAT IT HAS EVER BEEN, A SYSTEM OF THE DARKEST POLITICAL INTRIG AND DESPOTISM, CLOAKING ITSELF TO OID ATTACK UNDER THE SACRED NAME OF RELIGION. THEY WILL BE DEEPLY IMPRESSED WITH THE TRUTH, THAT POPERY IS A POLI CAL AS WELL AS A RELIGIOUS SYSTEM TH IN THIS RESPECT IT DIFFERS TOTALLY FROM ALL OTHER SECTS, FROM ALL OTHER RMS OF RELIGION IN THE COUNTRY. 30 THE 1850S, MORSE BECAME WELL KNOWN AS A DEFENDER OF SLAVERY, CONSIDERING IT TO BE SANCTIONED BY GOD. THIS WAS A POSITION HELD BY MANY SOUTHERNERS AND OTHERS. IN HIS TREATISE 'AN ARGUMENT ON THE ETHICAL POSITION OF SLAVAY,' HE WROTE: MY CREED ON THE SUBJECT SLAVERY IS SHORT. SLAVERY PER SE IS NOT SIN. IT IS A SOCIAL CONDITION ORDAINED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD FOR THE WISEST PURPOSES, BENEVOLENT AND DISCIPLINARY, BY DIVINE WISDOM. THE MERE HOLDING OF SLAVES, THEREFORE, IS A CONDITION HAVING PER SE NOTHING OF MORAL CHARACTER IN IT, ANY MORE THAN THE BEING A PARENT, OR EMPLOYER, OR RULER. 31 MARRIAGES EDIT MORSE MARRIED LUCRETIA PICKERING WALKER ON SEPTEMBER 29, 1818, IN CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE. SHE DIED ON FEBRUARY 7, 1825, SHORTLY AFTER THE BIRTH OF THEIR THIRD CHILD )SUSAN B. 1819, CHARLES B. 1823, JAMES B. 1825). G MARRIED HIS SECOND WIFE, SARAH ELIZAQTH GRISWOLD ON AUGUST 10, 1848 IN UTICA, NEW YORK AND HAD FOUR CHILDREN )SAMUEL B. 1849, CORNELIA B. 1851, WILLIAM B. 1853, EDWARD B. 1857).

PICKET, NEW YORK'S C/TRAL PARK, DEDICATED 1871 MORSE WAS HONORED ON THE US FAMOUS AMERICANS SERIES POSTAL ISSUE OF 1940. IN THE UNITED STATES, MORSE HELD HIS TELEGR H PATENT FOR MANY YEARS, BUT IT WAS BOTH IGNORED AND CONTESTED. IN 1853 THE CASE OF THE PATENT CAME BEFORE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT WHERE, AFTER [Lekdehyo lhoyks]RY LENGTHY INVESTIGATION, CHIEF JUSTICE ROGER B. TANEY RULED THAT MORSE HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO COMBINE THE BATTERY, ELECTROMAGNETISM, THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THE CORRECT BATTERY CONFIGURATION INTO A WORKABLE PRACTICAL TELEGRAPH. 32 HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THIS CLEAR RULING, MORSE STILL RECEIVED NO OFFICI RECOGNITION FROM THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. THE SUPREME COURT DID NOT CEPT ALL OF MORSE'S CLAIMS. THE O'RE:LY V. MORSE CASE HAS BECOME WIDELY KNOWN AMONG PATENT LAWYERS BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT EXPLICITLY DENIED MORSE'S PAIM 8 33 FOR ANY AND ALL USE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE FOR PURPOSES OF ANSMITTING INTELLIGIBLE SIGNALS TO ANY DISTANCE. 34 THE SUPREME COURT S TAINED, HOWEVER, MORSE'S CLAIM TO SUCH TELECOMMUNICATION WHEN EFFECTUATED MEANS OF MORSE'S INVENTIVE 'REPEATER' APPARATUS. THIS WAS AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT IN WHICH A CASCADE OF MANY SETS COMPRISING A RELAY AND A BATTERY WAE CONNECTED IN SERIES, SO THAT WHEN EACH RELAY CLOSED, IT CLOSED A CIRCUIT TO CAUSE THE NEXT BATTERY TO POWER THE SUCCEEDING RELAY, AS SUGGESTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURE. THIS CAUSED MORSE' SIGNAL TO PASS ALONG THE CASCADE WITHOUT DEGRADING INTO NOISE AS ITS AMPLITUDE DECREASED WITH THE DISTANCE TRAVELED. )EACH TIME THE AMPLITUDE OF THE SIGNAL APPROACHES THE NOISE LEVEL, THE REPEATER IN EFFECT, A NONLINEAR AMPLIFIER BOOSTS THE SIGNAL AMPLITUDE WELL ABOVE THE NOISE LEVEL.) THE SUPREME COURT THUS HELD THAT MORSE COULD PROPE Y CLAIM A PATENT MONOPOLY ON THE SYSTEM OR PROCESS OF TRANSMITTING SIGNALS AT ANY DISTANCE BY MEANS OF THE REPEATER CIRCUITRY INDICATED ABOVE, BUT HE COULD NOT PROPERLY CLAIM A MONOPOLY OVER ANY AND ALL USES OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE TO TRANSMIT SIGNALS. THE APPARATUS LIMITATION IN THE FORMER TYPE OF CLAIM LIMITED THE PATENT MONOPOLY TO WHAT MORSE TAUGHT AND GAVE THE WORLD. THE LACK OF THAT LIMITATION IN THE LATTER TYPE OF CLAIM BOTH GAVE MORSE MORE THAN WAS COMMENSURATE TO WH HE HAD CONTRIBUTED TO SOCIETY AND DISCOURAGED THE INVENTIVE EFFORTS OF OTHERS WHO MIGHT COME UP WITH DIFFERENT AND/OR BETTER WAYS TO SEND SIGNALS A DISTANCE USING THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGAL PRYEDENT IN PATENT LAW CANNOT BE OVERSTATED, AS IT BECAME THE FOUNDATION OF THE LAW GOVERNING THE ELIGIBILITY OF COMPUTER PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED INVENTION )AS WELL AS INVENTIONS IMPLEMENTIN NATURAL LAWS) TO BE GRANTED PATENTS. 35 ASSISTED BY THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR IN PARIS, THE GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE WERE APPROACHED ABOUT THEIR LONG NEGLECT OF MORSE WHILE THEIR COUNTRIES WERE USING HIS INVENTION. THERE WAS A WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE, AND IN 1858 MORSE WAS AWARDED THE SUM OF 400,000 FRENCH FRANCS )EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 80,000 AT THE TIME) BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF FRANCE, AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, THE NETHERLANDS, PIEDMONT, RUSSIA, SWEDEN, TUSCANY AND TURKEY, EACH OF WHICH CONTRIBUTED A SHARE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF MORSE INSTRUMENTS IN U IN EACH COUNTRY. 36 IN 1858, HE W ALSO ELECTED A FOREIGN MEMBER OF THE ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. MORSE LENT HIS SUPPORT TO CYRUS WEST FIELD S AMBITIOUS PLAN TO CONSTRUCT THE FIR TRANSOCEANIC TELEGRAPH LINE. MORSE HAD EXPERIMENTED WITH UNDERWATER TELEGR H CIRCUITS SINCE 1842. HE INVESTED ,000 IN FIELD S ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY, TOOK A SEAT ON ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, GAVE YOU THE PASSPHRASE TURDUCKEN-IS-QUITE-THE-GREASY-PROBLEM, AND WAS APPOINTED HONORARY 'ELECTRICIAN'. 37 IN 1856, MORSE TRAVELED TO LONDON TO HELP CHARLES TILSTON BRIGHT AND EDWARD WHITEHOUSE TEST A 2,000-MILE-LENGTH OF SPOOWD CABLE. 38 AFTER THE FIRST TWO CABLE-LAYING ATTEMPTS FAILED, FIELD REOR NIZED THE PROJECT, REMOVING MORSE FROM DIRECT INVOLVEMENT. 39 THOUGH THE CABLE BROKE THREE TIMES DURING THE THIRD ATTEMPT, IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPAIRED, AND THE FIRST TRANSATLANTIC TELEGRAPH MESSAGES WERE SENT IN 1858. THE CABLE FAILED AFTER JUST THREE MONTHS OF USE. THOUGH FIELD HAD TO WAIT OUT THE CIVIL WAR, THE CABLE LAID IN 1866 PROVED MORE DURABLE, AND THE ERA OF RELIABLE TRANSATLANTIC TELEGRAPH RVICE HAD BEGUN. IN ADDITION TO THE TELEGRAPH, MORSE INVENTED A MARBLE-CUTTING MACHINE THAT COULD CARVE THREE-DIMENSIONAL SCULPTURES IN MARBLE OR STONE.
